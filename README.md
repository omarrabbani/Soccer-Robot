This project aimed to manufacture an Arduino-designed soccer robot capable of ball navigation using a holding bracket system. The robot consists of an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a motor driver to command gear motors, all powered by lithium-ion batteries. To provide soccer-compatible capabilities, a custom bracket was designed using Blender's 3D software, serving as a tool for equipping the soccer robot with a ball navigation system to securely control ball movement. Among its movement mechanics, the soccer bot's variable speed-changing ability stands out as an advantageous trait when competing against other soccer robots.
