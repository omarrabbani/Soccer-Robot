This project presented the objective of manufacturing an Arduino designed soccer robot, one that would be capable of ball navigation based on a holding bracket system. This robot consists of an Arduino Nano microcontroller, a motor driver to command gear motors,
which are all powered by Lithium-ion batteries. To provide soccer compatible capabilities, a custom bracket was designed on Blender's 3D software, used as a means of equipping the soccer robot with a ball navigation tool to securely control ball movement.
Among its movement mechanics, the soccer bot's variable speed changing ability shines as an advantageous trait when up against other soccer robots.
